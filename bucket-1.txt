The relative power of labour and capital
Britain has some of the most restrictive trade union legislation in Europe. Already beleaguered, trade union rights are once again under attack in the form of the new Strike (Minimum Service Levels) Act 2023. Organised labour flexed its muscles during the recent strike wave, but, in most sectors, its power remains much diminished.

Workers and capital struggle over the surplus and the conditions of work. Work itself is shaped by these dual battles. In the present moment, new forms of digital surveillance and monitoring represent a key front.

This data focus explores the relative power that workers and capital have. Who is able to claim the surplus? Where are union protections and membership strongest, and (how) does that translate into better work?
